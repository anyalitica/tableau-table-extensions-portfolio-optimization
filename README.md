# Build an Investment Portfolio Optimisation Tool with Python in Tableau
## Overview
This tool provides an optimal allocation strategy using two of the most frequently used portfolio optimisation methodologies: Mean-variance Optimisation and Mean-semivariance Optimisation. A user selects 4 different companies they want to invest into and inputs an amount of money they want to invest using parameters at the top of the dashboard, and the Python script calculates the number of shares they should consider buying for each methodology. 

**THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. THIS TOOL IS PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, AND ITS RESULTS ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RETURNS.**
